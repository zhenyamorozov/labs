st1 = """An interface is like a contract between a function and a caller. The caller agrees to provide
certain parameters and the function agrees to do certain work.
For example, polyline requires four arguments: t has to be a Turtle; n has to be an integer;
length should be a positive number; and angle has to be a number, which is understood
to be in degrees.
These requirements are called preconditions because they are supposed to be true before

the function starts executing. Conversely, conditions at the end of the function are post-
conditions. Postconditions include the intended effect of the function (like drawing line

segments) and any side effects (like moving the Turtle or making other changes).

Preconditions are the responsibility of the caller. If the caller violates a (properly docu-
mented!) precondition and the function doesnâ€™t work correctly, the bug is in the caller, not

the function.
If the preconditions are satisfied and the postconditions are not, the bug is in the function.
If your pre- and postconditions are clear, they can help with debugging."""
